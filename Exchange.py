        retrieving the minimum order volume for a pair is easy if (base_alt) is

        not the case, and it is important for Triangular Arbitrage strategies to be able
        to handle flipped markets.
        In the case of a flipped market, we must infer the minimum volume based on how much of
        ALT we would end up trading, so therefore we must also convert the hardcoded min volumes
        using the current going price for the order.
